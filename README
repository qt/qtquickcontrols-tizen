Qt Quick Controls for Tizen - README
------------------------------------

Qt for Tizen is a purely community-driven port of Qt 5 to the Tizen mobile profile.
Tizen IVI profile as well as unofficial Netbook/Notebook profiles would benefit too.

Running examples in Tizen style
-------------------------------

To run a QML example using the Tizen style, execute this in directory, e.g.
 cd examples/touch
 QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE=Tizen qmlscene main.qml

For this to work, patched qtquickcontrols repository has to be build and original libprivateplugin.so
should be replaced by the newly built. The patched code is included in this Qt for Tizen release.
